# Demand Forecasting Using ARIMA and SARIMA

Demand forecasting is a crucial task for businesses that want to optimize their operations and stay ahead of the competition. ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) are two popular time-series forecasting techniques that can be used for demand forecasting.

ARIMA models are suitable for time-series data that exhibit stationary patterns, i.e., the statistical properties of the data do not change over time. SARIMA models, on the other hand, are used for time-series data that exhibit seasonal patterns.

By using historical sales data and applying ARIMA or SARIMA models, businesses can make accurate predictions about future demand for their products or services. This can help them to better manage their inventory levels, production schedules, and marketing strategies.

Overall, demand forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA is a powerful tool for businesses looking to improve their operations and make data-driven decisions.
